Crops all jpg files in current directory

Have you scanned a set of A4 pages, but then realised your scanner shows a black margin on the bottom and left? Use this script to losslessly get rid of the margins.

Takes "A4" jpg images that have been scanned in at 1200dpi, and crops them to A4 i.e. to get rid of black margin on bottom and left


REQUIRES:

Allow different sides to be cropped
Make it "smart" (recognise DPI?)
